      <LegalSection title="1. What cookies and browser storage are">
        <p>
          A <span className="text-foreground">cookie</span> is a small piece of text a website
          asks your browser to keep and to send back on later requests. It is how a site knows
          that the person asking for a page is already signed in. Some cookies are set by us,
          and are called first-party cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-foreground">Browser storage</span> (local storage) works
          similarly but stays in your browser and is never sent automatically with requests. We
          use it for preferences and for drafts that do not belong on a server.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use cookies to build advertising profiles, we do not sell data, and we do not
          embed third-party advertising or social tracking pixels. Because we set no non-essential
          cookies, there is no consent banner to dismiss — there is nothing for you to opt out of.

      <LegalSection title="4. Cookies set by others">
        <p>
          One part of the product runs on someone else&apos;s site: when a restaurant pays for a
          subscription, the payment gateway&apos;s own checkout opens on its own domain and sets
          its cookies there, under its own policy. We never see or store card, UPI or bank
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hosting and database provider sets only what is needed to deliver and protect the
          service. The AI provider used for menu scanning and dish images receives the images the
          restaurant chooses to send, and sets no cookies in the browser.
