/**
 * Sends a sign-in link to the page that can act on it.
 *
 * Supabase delivers a magic link in the shape `?code=…` (PKCE) or
 * `#access_token=…&refresh_token=…` (implicit). The query shape arrives in
 * the server-rendered page, so the root page can route it. The fragment
 * shape never reaches the server at all — the browser keeps it — so it has to
 * be read here and passed on.
 *
 * Which page it should be is decided by the link's own `type`:
 *
 *   type=recovery   a password reset, which the root page already handles
 *   type=magiclink  a sign-in link, which the admin panel handles
 *
 * The project is configured with a Site URL of `restrofi.in` — a bare host
 * with no scheme — so Supabase builds the link with a path instead of an
 * address and the browser lands on the Supabase domain with "requested path
 * is invalid" rather than here. Naming the destination in the request fixes
 * that where the allow list permits it; this covers the case where Supabase
 * falls back to the Site URL, so the link works either way.
