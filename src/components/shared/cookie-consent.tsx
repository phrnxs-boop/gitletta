/**
 * The cookie banner.
 *
 * It matches the rest of the product: the dark surface, the hairline border,
 * the single accent colour, the same rounded corners and the same two button
 * weights as the landing page's calls to action.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * - It renders only after mounting, and only when no choice is on record. The
 *   first avoids a hydration mismatch (the server cannot see local storage);
 *   the second is what makes a choice stick — once someone has answered, this
 *   never appears again on its own.
 * - Both answers are recorded. "Essential only" is not a dismissal; it is a
 *   decision, and it is what keeps an optional cookie from ever being set.
