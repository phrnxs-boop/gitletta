/**
 * The customer menu's theme.
 *
 * The menu a diner sees is the restaurant's, not the diner's. The owner app
 * has its own theme — light, dark or system — and the two must not fight: a
 * diner at a table in daylight should see the restaurant's menu, not whatever
 * their phone prefers, and the restaurant's choice should not change because
 * the owner has dark mode on in the office.
 *
 * So the menu takes the document over while it is up. The theme goes on
 * `<html>`, not only on the menu's own root, because Radix renders the cart
 * sheet and the item sheet in a portal on the document body — outside the
 * menu's wrapper — and a sheet in the wrong palette would be obvious.
